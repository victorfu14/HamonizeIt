# HarmonizeIt

 This was inspried by the [Google Doodle on Mar 21, 2019 celebrating Johann Sebastian Bach](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-johann-sebastian-bach). We hope we can recreate a more sophiscated generic version of the doodle.

 > Initial thoughts: an web app that takes input of a melody line user creates and output a harmonized line. User can choose own genre. And the app can offer intepretations of the harmonization.
